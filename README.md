This project aims to detect the leakage of LPG gas and window/door closed status.
GISMO-V is a microcontroller board for IOT applications based on the ESP32 controller

This repository gives the C/C++ codes for interfacing the following sensors to the ESP32 on the GISMO board:

1 .DHT1 1: Temperature & Humidity sensor
2 .HC-SR04 : Ultrasonic sensor
3 .Magnetic switch
4 .Soil Moisture sensor
5 .DS3231 : Real Time Clock
6 .Sound sensor
7 .MPU6050 : Multi-axes accelerometer and gyro
8 .BME280 : Bosch environment sensor(Temperature,Humidity,Atmospheric pressure,Altitude)
9 .OLED display (128 x 64)
10 .Relay : 5V operated
